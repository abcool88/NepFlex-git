        <strong>General Info about Application: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>NepaliCraig is designed and developed for all the people to search or post their needs.</p>
      <p>if you have question on how it works?:</p>
      <p>Example: I have a small brother who studies in class 4 and he is upgrading by 1 this year. Here he/we might want to
        list his old books and notes publicly so that somebody willing can reach out.</p>
      <p>Old stuff might fully occupy our home but cannot afford much to buy new one. If they publicized the item someone might
        reach out to them and they can get some amount of their old stuffs mentioning how the condition is and amount to
        that.</p>
      <p class="head_para">
        <strong> who are actively searching.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose Mr. ABCD wants a new or old item. He posts into NC and gets viewed by public. Public tries to reach
        out to him saying &ldquo;Hey, I have this option. If you like we can meet and talk&rdquo; he meets him gets the item
        he wanted on his expected cost. He happily takes that item to home because NC made so easier to connect people&rsquo;s
        choice.
